# Instructions for using the code to analyze ephys data for the manuscript "The neural and computational architecture of feedback dynamics in mouse cortex during stimulus report"

## Requirements
The code has been developed and tested in MATLAB r2021b (The Mathworks).

Paths to dependencies need to be changed within the main scripts.

## List of files
**plot_oudeLohuisData.m** will allow to plot the PSTHs shown in Fig. 1C

**plot_SteinmetzData.m** will allow to plot the PSTHs shown in Fig. 1E

## List of dependencies
**Datasets** 
The required data for Fig. 1C will be made available upon publication.

The data for Fig. 1D is available at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Dataset_from_Steinmetz_et_al_2019/9598406

**Software dependencies**
Custom-made helper functions have been included in the "helpers" folder

The code also requires some dependencies from https://github.com/nsteinme/steinmetz-et-al-2019
