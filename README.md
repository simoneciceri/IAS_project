# The neural and computational architecture of feedback dynamics in mouse cortex during stimulus report

"./ephys analysis" contains code and instructions concerning experimental data and Figure 1. 

"Figure2CDE.m", "Figure3AB.m" and "Figure3C.m" simulate the model in the nominal setup, 
and generate the corresponding figures.

"Morphing.m" allows changing the connectivity strengths with respect to the nominal setup, 
and plotting the resulting trajectories.

"./Figure4" contains instructions, code and data concerning Figure 4.
